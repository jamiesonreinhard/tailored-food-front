    "content": 'March 23, 2016. At a hospital hit hard by Ebola on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia, I met with the Head Pediatrician, Dr. Jude. Over a long conversation Dr. Jude shared "I treat malnourished children at my hospital with what UNICEF provides me, but I know most of these kids will die once I send them home. And there is no advice I can give to their mothers - there simply is no nutritious food available in local markets". This was the spark of a multi-year journey dedicated to designing and taking to market nutritious delicious low-cost food in Liberia. And as we started diving further into the landscape of food and malnutrition globally, I realized what our team was learning each day in Liberia could have far broader implications. Tailored Food was born to partner with incredible local nutrition entrepreneurs in designing and selling food products to families hardest hit by malnutrition, food products that are delicious, culturally-relevant, incredibly nutritious, and locally produced. Tailored is not a food company, but is a lean social enterprise consultancy that partners with local leaders in the markets we work. We have produced and sold to the extreme poor close to a million meals in the last 3 years. Interested in learning more? Please contact us.'
