    "bio": "Taylor Quinn is a social entrepreneur dedicated to building nutritious low-cost food systems. He moved to Liberia during the Ebola outbreak, and used his background as a food anthropologist to build a Liberian-owned business that produces nutritious low-cost delicious food (flavored cassava-based porridges) for consumers in extreme poverty. He has since taken this model to work in 10 countries, from Brazil to Congo, while also scaling up this approach at the UN World Food Programme."
